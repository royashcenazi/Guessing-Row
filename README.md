# Guessing-Row
A nice game that i have implemented while doing the course C# and the .Net framework in my Bsc.
The User defines the number of guesses and tries to guess the right letters hiding in a row, 
and for each guess, V stands for correct letter and location, and X for a correct letter
in a wrong location. if there is no sign than the letter and location is wrong.
